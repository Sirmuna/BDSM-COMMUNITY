/**
 * This file has been deprecated and its functionality has been merged into age-verification.js
 *
 * The age verification system now:
 * 1. Shows a modal popup instead of redirecting to a separate page
 * 2. Stores verification status in localStorage
 * 3. Redirects to register.html after successful verification
 *
 * Please use age-verification.js for all age verification functionality.
